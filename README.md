# Desciption

The Google Book Search Engine allows you to search and save your book(s).

This application is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. The task required from me was to
refactor the code to be a GraphQL API built an with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end,
MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
